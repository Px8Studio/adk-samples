STORYTELLING_INSTRUCTIONS: str = f"""The following template is designed to guide your generation process for tasks like creating storyboards, generating keyframe images, and animating video sequences.

### **Universal Cinematic Scene Generation Template**

Use this structured template to define the visual parameters for any video or image generation task. Filling out these sections methodically ensures clarity, detail, and a high-quality, cinematic result.

---

#### **[SECTION 1: STYLE & MEDIUM DEFINITION]**

**Purpose:** This section establishes the foundational aesthetic and technical execution of the scene. It is the most critical component, defining the "look and feel" before any content is described.

**Elements to Consider:**
* **Medium:** Is it live-action, 2D animation, 3D CGI, claymation, watercolor, etc.?
* **Artistic Style:** What is the visual language? (e.g., photorealistic, hyper-stylized, anime, Art Deco, impressionistic).
* **Quality & Influences:** Reference specific studios, artists, or benchmark productions (e.g., "in the style of a major animation studio," "quality of a professional nature documentary," "inspired by the work of a distinctive indie film director").
* **Texture & Fidelity:** Describe the surface details (e.g., "detailed clay with visible tool marks," "hyperrealistic skin pores and fabric weaves," "clean vector lines with no gradients").
* **Motion & Frame Rate:** Specify the feel of the movement (e.g., "smooth 60fps motion," "classic 24fps cinematic feel," "choppy 12fps stop-motion effect," "dramatic slow-motion").

---

#### **[SECTION 2: PRIMARY SUBJECT & ACTION]**

**Purpose:** To clearly identify the main character, object, or element that serves as the scene's anchor. This is who or what the audience should focus on first.

**Elements to Consider:**
* **Subject Identity:** Who or what is it? (e.g., "A weathered astronaut," "a gleaming new electric car," "a single droplet of rain").
* **Key Features:** Describe its most important visual characteristics (e.g., "tattered suit with a cracked helmet visor," "iridescent pearl-white paint job," "refracting the light around it").
* **Action / Pose:** What is the subject actively doing, or what is its current state? (e.g., "planting a flag on a dusty surface," "speeding down a coastal highway," "hanging from the tip of a leaf").
* **Position in Frame:** Where is the subject located? (e.g., "center-frame," "occupying the left third of the screen," "emerging from the foreground").

---

#### **[SECTION 3: SECONDARY SUBJECT / FOCAL POINT]**

**Purpose:** To define the object of the primary subject's attention, the element it's interacting with, or a secondary element that balances the composition and adds narrative depth.

**Elements to Consider:**
* **Object Identity:** What is the secondary point of interest? (e.g., "a mysterious alien artifact," "a futuristic charging station," "the puddle on the ground below").
* **Relationship to Primary:** How does it connect to the primary subject? (e.g., "the destination of the car," "the object of the astronaut's discovery," "the target of the falling droplet").
* **State & Detail:** Describe its condition and appearance relative to the primary subject (e.g., "glowing with an internal light," "sleek and metallic," "rippling as the droplet is about to hit").

---

#### **[SECTION 4: ENVIRONMENT & SETTING]**

**Purpose:** To build the world around the subjects, providing context, scale, and atmosphere. This section describes everything that isn't the primary or secondary subject.

**Elements to Consider:**
* **Location:** Where is this scene taking place? (e.g., "lunar surface," "a sun-drenched Mediterranean coast," "a macro view of a lush forest floor").
* **Time of Day & Weather:** (e.g., "harsh midday sun," "pre-dawn twilight with heavy fog," "during a torrential downpour at night").
* **Background & Foreground Elements:** What else populates the scene? (e.g., "distant Earth in the black sky," "craggy cliffs and azure water," "out-of-focus moss and ferns").
* **Branding/Signage (for ads):** If applicable, describe the placement, appearance, and integration of any logos, brand colors, or specific products (e.g., "A billboard in the background displays a generic brand logo," "The characters are wearing vests with a discreet, embroidered brand symbol").

---

#### **[SECTION 5: CINEMATOGRAPHY & LIGHTING]**

**Purpose:** This is the "director's" section. It dictates precisely how the scene is framed, shot, and lit to guide the viewer's eye and evoke a specific feeling.

**Elements to Consider:**
* **Shot Type & Angle:** How is the scene being viewed? (e.g., "Wide establishing shot from a high angle," "Over-the-shoulder tracking shot," "Extreme close-up from a low angle," "Point-of-view (POV) shot").
* **Lens & Focus:** Describe the camera's optical properties. (e.g., "Shot on a wide-angle 24mm lens to emphasize scale," "Using a telephoto lens to compress the background," "Shallow depth of field with a wide aperture like `$f/1.8$` to isolate the subject, creating soft bokeh in the background").
* **Composition:** How are the elements arranged in the frame? (e.g., "Rule of thirds," "strong leading lines," "symmetrical framing," "dynamic Dutch angle").
* **Lighting Scheme:** Describe the source, quality, and color of the light. (e.g., "Dramatic backlighting creating a silhouette," "Soft, diffuse light from an overcast sky," "High-contrast, low-key lighting with hard shadows (chiaroscuro)," "Motivated lighting from in-scene sources like neon signs or a fireplace").
* **Color Grading:** Define the overall color palette and tone (e.g., "Warm, golden-hour tones," "cool, desaturated blues and grays," "vibrant, high-saturation commercial look").

---

#### **[SECTION 6: MOOD & ATMOSPHERE]**

**Purpose:** To provide a final, definitive statement on the emotional core of the scene. This acts as a unifying guide for all the preceding elements.

**Elements to Consider:**
* **Core Emotion:** What is the primary feeling the viewer should experience? (e.g., "Nostalgic and heartwarming," "tense and suspenseful," "awe-inspiring and majestic," "energetic and optimistic").
* **Pace & Energy:** What is the rhythm of the scene? (e.g., "serene and contemplative," "fast-paced and chaotic," "powerful and deliberate").
* **Sensory Descriptors:** Use words that evoke senses beyond sight (e.g., "the feeling of crisp, cold air," "the oppressive humidity of a jungle," "the quiet warmth of a cozy room").
